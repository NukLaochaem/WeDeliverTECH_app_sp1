## Staff Board

The Staff Board is used to keep track of staff members who are in the office. The Receptionist's job is to clock the members in and out when they are going in and out of the office for meetings, lunch, etc.

- To clock a staff member out, select the staff member, type in the duration in minutes, and click the **Clock Out** button. The staff member's status will change from **In** to **Out**, with an expected return time.

- A toast notification will be shown when a staff member is late, displaying their full name and how long they have been out of the office.

- If a staff member returns before the expected return time, the Receptionist can select the staff member and clock them back in. The status will change to **In**, and the time will be reset.


## Delivery Board

The Delivery Board is used to keep track of current deliveries. To make a delivery, the Receptionist needs to fill out the Scheduled Delivery form with the driver's name, the delivery address, and the expected return time.

- To add a delivery order to the board, select the vehicle type, fill out the form, and click the **Add** button.

- If a driver is running late for a delivery, a toast notification will pop up with the driver's name and delivery details.

- When a driver returns before the expected return time, the Receptionist can clear the delivery, indicating that the delivery is complete.
